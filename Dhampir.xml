            <h4>DHAMPIR TRAITS</h4>
            <p>
                Dhampirs share certain abilities with Vampires thanks to the curse they share.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase</span>
                Your Dexterity increases by 2 and Charisma by 1.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Age</span>
                Dhampirs are long lived thanks to their vampire heritage. They reach adulthood at the same rate as a human, but can live for several hundred years.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Size</span>
                Dhampirs have the same range of height and weight as humans. Your size is medium.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Speed</span>
                Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Darkvision</span>
                Cursed by your vampire heritage, you can easily see through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Vampiric Resistance</span>
                You have resistance to Necrotic damage.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Sunlight Sensitivity</span>
                You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Vampiric Magic</span>
                You know the minor illusion cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the charm person spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the misty steps spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Bite</span>
                Your fangs are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you can deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Blood Thirst</span>
                In the heat of battle, you can throw yourself into a bloodlust. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Languages</span>
                You can speak, read, and write Common.
